      <a href="3.html"  >Over fallen dawn curtains droop closed, and morning’s faint sheen seeps silently inward, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"   class="even">pitching lambent blues across shelf and armchair alike, a distant clamour laving the sweatcreased sheets of nightfall whilst sight ambles from floor to ceiling, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"  >to where concentration lolls in folds of ungrasped opportunity, whirling with anxiety to drift, degraded and ruminant, as I want him and want want and yet do not, not wanting him at all, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"   class="even">wanting dislocation, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"  >in a deep, unbridged vastness where faults recede, where his jabbering awkwardness and rubicund grin and fetid pits and member would ebb, inexorably, to nought, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"   class="even">their phantoms expunged in idle gazing, betrothed to hope’s shadow, </a>

      <a href="3.html"   class="even">for the mysterious, unexpected event that might appear but that does not, permitting light’s lazy reach to sharpen and dull eventlessly, as the bedbound moment elapses, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"  >as I sigh, plaintively, at a sterile world, familiar and smaller, to be yet smaller soon.</a>
