      <a href="3.html"   class="even">to trammel dream with duty, beneath a suffocating fog of commitment that rusts lustres dull, forcing stertorous breath to fall fretful, dissatisfying and diminished, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"  >with ribcage throbbing, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"   class="even">irruent, collapsing, whilst hands slump weighted to type, to respond, to convey after days of silence that I cannot meet because I will not meet because I must not meet, the greyed phrases recurring to inscribe uncertainties that are certainties and certainties that are not, platitudes and pragmatics, spurting line on line to unload the heft, </a> 
      <a href="3.html"  >to take back control, </a>
      <a href="3.html"   class="even">to debouch forced thoughts into the darkling waters of distance, suspiring, fully, in embryonic ataraxy.</a>
