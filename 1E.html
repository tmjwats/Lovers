        <a href="3.html"   class="even">through hair, through underwear and spattered over flesh and bedspread alike, her back slick wet, her back dripping, nitid with a chest-flung perspiration that streams whilst thighs rub raw and stretch to the thrusting, the scratching, the bite, in sensations engulfed by eddies of hot breath and rage and spat on withdrawal, as come dribbles arsehole down, two hips thrashed aflame, recoiling, her dark mop buried in the sheets and cunt and anus gaping, </a> 
        <a href="3.html"  >to nothing, </a> 
        <a href="3.html"   class="even">to gloom, to the silence stuffed cavern where the softened reek of shit chokes quietude and blackness, where yellowed faecal streaks cross from cock to cotton with inhalation and judder as I roll to rags beside, clasping trousers, shoes,  whilst vision pours into mine, in a bloodshot, moistened intensity, unwavering before whimpers fall forth, before she asks and pleads and beseeches me to stay, her lip wobbling and body scrunched, knees to nipples and eyes searching, </a> 
        <a href="3.html"  >and I think no,</a> 
        <a href="3.html"   class="even">not now, not ever, not at dayâ€™s end, nor whilst eyelids clench need, their miseries flung forward to cling and claw and cleave refusal, in denial, beggeting a no, in a slow and rehearsed meaninglessness that prevails because it must, because the suffocating weight of idiocy demands, because the blubbering confusion persists, and because I cannot brook the lies of tenderness ahead, which declare that this is sufficient and aver that I am not the bastard bearer of sadness, because I am the bastard bearer of sadness, and destitution looms, so I leave, tiptoeing lightly down stairs, </a> 
        <a href="3.html"  >to where tears fall and ruminations congeal, </a> 
        <a href="3.html"   class="even">where bodies ache and a leaden carpet of possibility unfurls slowly unto dusk.</a>
