      <a href="xrup.html"  >over fallen dawn curtains droop closed, and morning’s faint sheen seeps silently inward, </a> 
      <a href="xruw.html"   class="even">pitching lambent blues across shelf and armchair alike, a distant clamour laving the sweatcreased sheets of nightfall whilst sight ambles from floor to ceiling, </a> 
      <a href="xrut.html"  >to where concentration lolls in folds of ungrasped opportunity, whirling with anxiety to drift, degraded and ruminant, as I want him and want want and yet do not, not wanting him at all, </a> 
      <a href="xruh.html"   class="even">wanting dislocation, in a deep, unbridged vastness where faults recede, where his jabbering awkwardness and rubicund grin and fetid pits and member would ebb, inexorably, to nought, </a> 
      <a href="xruy.html"   >their phantoms expunged in idle gazing, betrothed to hope’s shadow, </a>
      <a href="xrus.html"  class="even">hungry for someone, for something, </a> 
      <a href="xruj.html"  >for the mysterious, unexpected event that might appear but that does not, permitting light’s lazy reach to sharpen and dull eventlessly, as the bedbound moment elapses, </a> 
      <a href="xrua.html"  class="even">as I sigh, plaintively, at a sterile world, familiar and smaller, to be yet smaller soon</a>
