      <a href="1B Words Image.html"  class="even">grasping through murk at armfuls of emptiness, at midnight, when dumb thoughts drum anxious and dreams recede to the stiff voice of despair, which whispers dissatisfactions, regrets, failures and disappointment in imprecations for the foibles, the narcissism and the selfishness that waxes with solitude, </a> 
      <a href="1C Words Image .html" >in the turbid, whirring hollow of a neighbouring pillow, </a> 
      <a href="1D Words Image.html"  class="even">consuming as bodies writhe, as clocks turn, as you lie blind to the dim lucence of deliverance that glisters above, </a> 
      <a href="1E Words Image.html" >where crowds stare on and I sob, impotent to the reddened tide that climbs ever higher, </a> 
      <a href="1F Words Image.html"  class="even">ever faster, </a>
      <a href="1G Words Image.html" >to stain and submerge each floor perched purchase, each saturnine sculpture, whilst you blench and tense and remain, abandoned though not drowned, </a>
      <a href="1H Words Image.html"  class="even">afloat with the life you cannot live.</a>
